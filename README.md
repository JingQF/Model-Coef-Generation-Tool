# Model-Coef-Generation-Tool

## Instruction

1. This tool aims to evaluate different methods employing in ship maneuvering simulation. 
2. I developed this tool for smooth generating hydrodynamic coefficients based on existing approaches.
3. The Matlab code is straightforward to understand if you are familiar with ship maneuvering, especially the MMG model.
4. This tool is still under heavy construction. The first version is not complete in function.
5. I uploaded it to motivate myself to go ahead. 
6. Leave your comments without any hesitate if you want to know more.
